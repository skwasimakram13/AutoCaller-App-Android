# 📞 AutoCaller App (Android)

**AutoCaller** is an Android app designed for businesses like CSPs, shop owners, or field agents who need to call a large number of customers automatically using pre-recorded voice messages. This app allows you to initiate calls from your own device and plays a selected voice message when the call is picked up by the recipient.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 Import contacts from CSV files (multiple numbers supported)
- 🔊 Play your pre-recorded audio automatically after the call is picked
- 📞 Uses your own SIM and default dialer to make calls
- ✅ Automatically retries failed calls up to 2 times
- 🛑 Stop calling anytime or skip to the next contact manually
- 🗂 Export call logs (CSV) with status and retry count
- 🔒 No server involved, all data stays on your phone

---

## 🛠 Permissions Required

- `CALL_PHONE` - To make phone calls from your device
- `READ_PHONE_STATE` - To monitor call status (picked, ended)
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` / `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` - To read the audio file
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - To run the calling in background

---

## 📁 CSV Format for Contacts

The CSV should be a simple plain text `.csv` file with phone numbers. For example:

```
9876543210
9123456789
9998887777
```

Only digits are extracted automatically, so formatting like `+91-98765 43210` is also accepted.
